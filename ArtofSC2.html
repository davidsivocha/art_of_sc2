<!-- Laying Plans -->
	<h1 class="sectionHeader"><a name="Laying Plans"></a> Laying Plans </h1>
	<ol>
		<li><em>Sun Tzu would have said:</em> The Art of War of vital importance to the player.</li>
		<li>Hence it is a subject of inquiry which can on no account be neglected.</li>
		<li>A game or a series of games, is governed by five constant factors, to be taken into account in one’s calculations, when seeking to determine the influences on a match. These are:
		 
		<blockquote>
		<b>Will</b> | <b>Heaven</b> | <b>Earth</b> | <b>The Commander</b> | <b>Methods and Discipline </b> 
		</blockquote>

		<li><b>Will</b> is a player’s mental strength.It causes one’s emotions and actions per minute to be in complete accord with the players intention, so that the player is able to act clear headed, undismayed by any danger.</li>
		
		<p class="comment">
		An example of a player with poor Will was IdrA. IdrA at times would defeat himself because his 	emotions and perception of the situation would cloud his judgment, resulting in BM & rage quitting.
		</p>
		
		<li><b>Heaven</b> signifies the maps which are played. Large and small, open and closed.</li>
		
		<p class="comment">
		The difference between Heaven and Earth is scale.
		</p>
		
		<li><b>Earth</b> comprises of specific areas of a map, distances great and small; danger and security, open ground and narrow passes the chances of victory and defeat.</li> <br />
		<li><b>The Commander</b> stands for the player’s ability to act as a general, to plan strategies and lead an army to victory.</li>
		
		<br />
	
		<li>These five heads should be familiar to every general: he who masters them will be victorious; he who masters them not will fail.</li>
		<li>Therefore, in your deliberations, when seeking to determine the state of a game, or with whom lies the advantage, make a comparison, in this way:</li>
		
		<blockquote>
		Which of the two players has the stronger Will? <br /> <br />
		Which of the two players has the strongest macro? <br /><br />
		With whom lies the advantages derived from Heaven and Earth? <br /><br />
		Which of the players has the strongest micro? <br /><br />
		Which army has a stronger unit composition? <br /> <br />
		On which side do the units have stronger upgrades? <br /><br />
		Which of the players has more to gain from winning? <br />
		</blockquote>
	
		<li>By means of these seven considerations I can forecast victory or defeat.</li>
		<li>The general that hearkens to my counsel and acts upon it, will conquer: let such a one be retained in my clan! The general that hearkens not to my counsel not acts upon it, will suffer defeat: let such a one be dismissed.</li>
		<li>While following the rules I set forth, take advantage of luck.</li>
		<li>While following my council on laws of strategy, you must be guided by the actions of the enemy. Therefore, according as circumstances are favorable one should modify one’s plans.</li>
		<li>All warfare is based on deception.</li>
		<li>Hence, when able to attack, we must seem unable; when using our forces, we must seem inactive; when we are near, we must make the enemy believe we are far away; when far away, we must make him believe we are near.</li>
		<li>Hold out baits to entice the enemy, Feign disorder, and crush him.</li>
		<li> If he is secure at all points, be prepared for him. If he is in superior strength, evade him.</li>
		
		<p class="comment">When you push against your enemy and find that his defense is secure at all points; his ramps are guarded, his vision and units prevent pylons or drops, and his mineral line is defended stay your hand. Your opponent has built a strong shell that will hold off your advances. If you attack you will enable your opponent to gain control of the map, in chess this mistake is called letting your opponent attack to expand. Better is it to prepare for when your opponent leaves the safety of his shell. There he will be ill-prepared and you can crush him.</p>
		
		<li> If your opponent has a weak <b>will</b>, seek to irritate him. Pretend to be weak, that he may grow arrogant.
		</li>	
		
		<p class="comment">Always remember while playing against humans that you are battling a human. Without training, most of us are weak willed and easily provoked. An angry player preforms worse, they make irrational decisions, they are easily tricked and confused. An opponent’s macro, micro and strategy may be solid, but if you hallucinate some colossus and win because of an early gg, did their skill matter?</p>
	
		<li>If he is taking his ease, give him no rest. If his forces are united, separate them.</li>
		
		<p class="comment">You always want your opponent to feel uncomfortable. As a rule, do not let him get into his rhythm. Your opponent will be at his worse when he is struggling to do something wherez he is normally at ease.</p>
	
		<li>Attack him where he is unprepared, appear where you are not expected.</li>
		<li>Now the player who wins a battle makes many calculations in his mind before the game or match is fought. The general who loses a game makes but few calculations beforehand. Thus do many calculations lead to victory, and few calculations to defeat: how much more no calculation at all! It is by attention to this point that I can foresee who is likely to win or lose.</li>
		
		<p class="comment">Calculations can be build orders, general battle plans, specific tactics and gambits.</p>
	</ol>	

<!-- Waging War -->
	<h1 class="sectionHeader"><a name="Waging War"></a> Waging War </h1>
	<ol>
		<li><em>Sun Tzu would have said:</em> In the operation of a game, where you have constructed a max supply army, with overloads/depos/pylons enough to enable that mass, the expenditure at home and at the front, including research and upgrades, necessary items such as expansions and vespene geysers, and sums spent on unit producing structures and workers, will reach a total of thousands of minerals and hundreds of gas per minute. Such is the cost of raising an army of max supply.</li>
		<li>When you play a game, if victory is long in coming, your <abbr title="Actions Per Minute">APM</abbr> will decline, your enthusiasm will lessen and the number of expansions which are safe will become few. If you attack a position that is well defended by static defenses and enemy units, you will exhaust your strength.</li>
		<li>Again, if the game is long, the resources at your main will not be equal to the task.
		In a tournament, when your <abbr title="Actions Per Minute">APM</abbr> has declined, and your enthusiasm lessened, lesser players will take advantage of your weakened state. Then no man, however wise, will be able to avert the consequences that must ensue.</li>
		<li>Thus, though we have heard of stupid hast in war, cleverness has never been seen associated with long delays.</li>
		<li>In war, then, let your great objective be victory, not lengthy matches and series.</li>
	</ol>

<!-- Attack by Stratagem -->
	<h1 class="sectionHeader"><a name="Attack by Stratagem"></a> Attack by Stratagem </h1>
	<ol>
		<li><em>Sun Tzu would have said:</em> In the practical art of war, the best thing of all is to take the enemy’s base whole and intact; to shatter and destroy it not so good. So, too, it is better to destroy a player’s unit producing structures than to destroy their army.</li>
		<li>Hence to fight and conquer his army with your army is not supreme excellence; supreme excellence consists in breaking the enemy’s will or economy, without engaging their army.</li>
		<li>Thus the highest form of generalship is to deny your opponent’s economy; the next best is to prevent the massing of the enemy’s forces; the next in order is to attack the enemy’s army in the field; and the worst policy of all is to attack fortified positions.</li>
		<li>The rule is, not to attack fortified positions if it can possibly be avoided. The preparations of many banelings, siege tanks, and colossi will take many minutes, and building up an army capable to support and drive home the attack will take many more minutes.</li>
	
		<p class="comment">While attacking fortified positions is a bad idea, it is less of a bad idea in Starcraft 2 then in the waring states period or the European medieval ages. The main difference is that in the medieval ages they didn’t have seige tanks and banelings to crash down the enemy gate. The point here is why attack where your opponent is strong when you could attack where he is weak, and not expecting you?</p>
	
		<li>The player, unable to control his irritation, will launch his forces to the assault like swarming ants, with the result that one-third of his units are destroyed, while the base continues to mine. Such are the disastrous effects of a siege.</li>
		<li>Therefore the skillful player subdues his opponent’s units without any direct engagement; he undermines the enemy position without attacking fortified bases; he defeats them without long games in decisive series.</li>
		<li>With his forces intact he will dispute the title of world's best, and thus without suffering defeat, his triumph will be complete. This is the method of attacking by stratagem.</li>
		<li>It is the rule in war, if our forces are ten to the opponent’s one, to surround him; if five to one, to attack him; if twice as numerous, to divide our army into two.</li>
		<li>If equally matched, we can offer battle; if slightly inferior in numbers, we can avoid his forces; if quite unequal in every way, we can, gg.</li>
		<li>Hence, though an obstinate fight may be made by few units, in the end it must be destroyed by the larger force.</li>
		<li>Now the player and his forces are the shield of the economy; if the shield is complete at all points; the economy will be strong; if the shield is lacking, the economy will be weak.</li>
	
		<p class="comment">An alternative translation would be: the player is the sole commander of his forces, it is through his ability alone that victory or ruin is achieved.</p>
		<li>There are three ways in which a player can bring misfortune upon his army:</li>
			<blockquote>
		By commanding the units to preform actions or spells, being ignorant of the fact that it cannot obey. This is called hobbling the army. <br /><br />
		By attempting to control an army in the same way that he macros his economy, being ignorant of the tactics and strategies that are befitting an army. This causes an army to be under utilized. <br /><br />
		By creating control groups of his army without discrimination, through ignorance of the military principles of adaptation to circumstances. This saps the strength of the units. <br /><br />
			</blockquote>
		<li>But when the army is restless and purposeless, trouble is sure to come from the other player. This is simply bringing anarchy into the army, and flinging victory away.</li>
	
		<p class="comment">Military units should be constructed with a specific purpose. Units which are constructed without purpose will become a distraction to the player and will open up the path of victory to your opponent.</p>
		<li>Thus we may know that there are five essentials for victory:</li>
			<blockquote>
		He will win who knows when to fight and when not to fight.<br /><br />
		He will win who knows how to handle both superior and inferior forces.<br /><br />
		He will win whose army is animated by the same spirit throughout all their control groups
			<p class="comment">military maxim: march divided, fight concentrated.</p>
		He will win who, prepared himself, waits to take the enemy unprepared.<br /><br />
		He will win who understands tactics, has unshakable <b>will</b>, and control of <b>Heaven</b> and <b>Earth</b><br />
			</blockquote>
		<li>Hence the saying: If you know your opponent and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred games. If you know yourself but not your opponent, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither your opponent nor yourself, you will lose in every game.</li>
	</ol>	

<!-- Tactical Disposition -->
	<h1 class="sectionHeader"><a name="Tactical Disposition"></a> Tactical Disposition </h1>
	<ol>
		<li><em>Sun Tzu would have said:</em> The 1337 gamers of old first put themselves beyond the possibility of defeat, and then waited for an opportunity of defeating the opponent.</li>
		<li>To secure ourselves against defeat lies in our own hands, but the opportunity of defeating the opponent is provided by the opponent himself.</li>
		<li>Thus the gamer is able to secure himself against defeat, but cannot make certain of defeating the opponent.</li>
		<li>Hence the saying: One may know how to win without being able to do it.</li>
		<li>Security against defeat implies defensive tactics; ability to defeat the opponent means taking the offensive.</li>
		<li>Standing on the defensive indicates insufficient strength; attacking, a superabundance of strength.</li>
		<li>The player who is skilled in defense hides in the least scouted regions of the map; he who is skilled in attack flashes forth from the most advantageous of positions. Thus on the one hand we have ability to protect ourselves; on the other, a victory that is complete.To see victory only when it is obvious is not the pinnicle of excellence.</li>
		<li>Neither is it the pinnicle of excellence if you battle and win and the whole world says, &ldquo;you are so Gosu!&rdquo;</li>
		<li>To lift a feather is no sign of great strength; to see the sun and moon is no sign of sharp sight; to hear the noise of thunder is no sign of a quick ear.</li>
		
		<p class="comment">Homer said that when Achilles fought it was like a man fighting against children, how much greater strength and experience does the man possesses.</p>
		
		<li>Hence his victories bring him neither reputation for wisdom nor credit for courage.</li>
		<li>He wins his battles by making no mistakes. Making no mistakes is what establishes the certainty of victory, for it means conquering an enemy that is already defeated.</li>
		<li>Hence the skillful gamer puts himself into a position which makes defeat impossible, and does not miss the moment for defeating his opponent.</li>
		<li>Thus it is that in war the victorious strategist only seeks battle after the victory has been won, whereas he who is destined to lose first fights and afterwards looks for victory.</li>
		
		<p class="comment">simply put, the pinnicle of excellence is having already won the battle before the game even starts.</p>
		<li>The grandmaster meditates upon his <b>will</b>, and tirelessly practices his macro and micro; thus it is in his power to control success.</li>
		<li>A victorious army opposed to a routed one, is as a pound's weight placed in the scale against a single grain.</li>
		<li>The onrush of a conquering force is like the bursting of pent-up waters into a chasm a thousand miles deep.</li>
	</ol>

<!-- Energy -->
	<h1 class="sectionHeader"><a name="Energy"></a>Energy</h1>
	<ol>
		<li><em>Sun Tzu would have said:</em> The control of a large force is the same principle as the control of a few men: it is merely a question of dividing up their numbers.</li>
		<li>Fighting with a large army under your command is nowise different from fighting with a small one: it is merely a question of creating effective control groups.</li>
		<li>To ensure that your side may withstand the brunt of the enemy's attack and remain unshaken&mdash;this is effected by direct and indirect maneuvers.</li>
		<li>That the impact of your forces be like a boulder thrown against an egg&mdash;this is effected by the science of weak points and strong.</li>
		<li>In all fighting, the direct method may be used for joining battle, but indirect methods will be needed in order to secure victory.</li>
		<li>Indirect tactics, efficiently applied, are inexhaustible as the sky, unending as the flow of rivers and streams; like the sun and moon, they end but to begin anew; like the four seasons, they pass away to return once more.</li>
		<li>There are not more than five musical notes, yet the combinations of these five give rise to more melodies than can ever be heard.</li>
		<li>There are not more than five primary colors (blue, yellow, red, white, and black), yet in combination they produce more hues than can ever been seen.</li>
		<li>There are not more than five cardinal tastes (sour, acrid, salt, sweet, bitter), yet combinations of them yield more flavors than can ever be tasted.</li>
		<li>In a game, there are not more than two methods of attack&mdash;the direct and the indirect; yet these two in combination give rise to an endless series of maneuvers.</li>
		<li>The direct and the indirect lead on to each other in turn. It is like moving in a circle&mdash;you never come to an end. Who can exhaust the possibilities of their combination?</li>
		<li>The attack-move is like the rush of a torrent which will even roll stones along in its course.</li>
		<li>The quality of decision must be like the well-timed swoop of a falcon which enables it to strike and destroy its victim.</li>
		<li>Energy may be likened to the bending of a crossbow; decision, to the releasing of a trigger.</li>
		
		<p class="comment">A wise general must make many calculations and preparations before a fight, this is attaining victory before the battle. This is energy, but knowing when to release that energy is just as important.</p>
		
		<li>Amid the uncertainty and noise of battle, there may be seem to be disorder and yet no real disorder at all; amid confusion and chaos, your units may be without head or tail, yet it will be proof against defeat.</li>
		<li>Simulated disorder is a show of perfect discipline, simulated fear is a show of courage; simulated weakness is a show of strength.</li>
		<li>Hiding order beneath the cloak of disorder is simply a question of control groups; concealing courage under a show of timidity presupposes a fund of latent energy; masking strength with weakness is to be effected by tactical dispositions.</li>
		
		<p class="comment">With the accurate use of multiple control groups armies can quickly snap into ranks, this will allow one to mask the organization of their army, but still fight effectively when the time arises. Tu Mu, a poet from the 800s explains: &ldquo;If you wish to feign confusion in order to lure the enemy on, you must first have perfect discipline; if you wish to display timidity in order to entrap the enemy, you must have extreme courage; if you wish to parade your weakness in order to make the enemy over-confident, you must have exceeding strength.&rdquo;</p>
		
		<li>Thus one who is skillful at keeping his opponent on the move maintains deceitful appearances, according to which the enemy will act. He sacrifices something, that the enemy may snatch at it.</li>
		
		<p class="comment">SC2 is a game of limited information. All your opponent knows about you is what he can see, by extension this can mean what you show him. If you maintain false appearance to your opponent then they will create false responses and act in incorrect ways, believing what they see to be real.</p>
		
		<li>By holding out baits, he keeps him on the march; then with the right units he lies in wait for him.</li>
		<li>The clever combatant looks to the effect of synergy, combined energy, and does not require too much from individual units. Hence his ability to select the right unit and utilize combined energy.</li>
		<li>When he utilizes combined energy his units become a ball of death. For it is the nature of a ball to remain motionless on level ground and to move when on a slope.</li>
		<li>Thus the energy developed by good unit composition is as the momentum of a heavy ball rolled down a mountain thousands of feet in height. So much on the subject of energy.</li>
	</ol>

<!-- Weak Points and Strong -->
	<h1 class="sectionHeader"><a name="Weak Points and Strong"></a>Weak Points and Strong</h1>
	<ol>	
	
		<li><em>Sun Tzu would have said:</em> Whoever is first in position on a map and awaits the coming of the enemy, will be prepared for the fight; whoever is second will arrive unprepared.
	Therefore the clever player imposes his will on his opponent, but does not allow the opponent's will to be imposed on him.</li>
		<li>By holding out advantages to him, he can cause his adversary to approach of his own accord; or by inflicting damage, he can make it impossible for the enemy to draw near.</li>
	
		<p class="comment">Mutalisks bate to marines on top of banlings. Siege tank's long range and splash damage preventing the advance of the zerg swarm.</p>
	
		<li>If the enemy is taking his ease, harass him; if well supplied with minerals/gas, starve him while preventing him from capturing more; if turtling, force him to expand.</li>
		<li>Appear at points which your opponent must hasten to defend; march swiftly to places where you are not expected.</li>
		<li>You may move a force over great distances without fear, if it travels through areas where your opponent is not.</li>
		<li>You can be sure of succeeding in your attacks if you only attack places which are undefended. You can ensure the safety of your defense if you only hold positions that cannot be attacked.</li>
		
		<p class="comment">Scout intensively for weak points or bait your opponent out of position and strike like lightning, leaving before forces come to reinforce.</p>
	
		<li>Hence the player is skillful in attack whose opponent does not know what to defend; and he is skilled in defense whose opponent does not know what to attack.</li>
		
		<p class="comment">Cause your opponent to suffer doubt and uncertainly by manipulating their understanding of the game</p>
	
		<li>O diving art of subtlety and secrecy! Through you we learn to be invisible, through you undetectable; and hence we can hold the opponent's fate in our hands.</li>
		
		<p class="comment">It was said of the infamous chess prodigy Bobby Fischer that he held his opponents in contempt.</p>
	
		<li>You may advance and be absolutely unstoppable, if you make for your opponent's weak points; you may retreat and be safe from pursuit if your movements are more rapid than those of your opponent.</li>
		<li>If we wish to fight, your opponent can be forced to engage enough though he be sheltered behind static defenses. All we need do is attack some other place that he will be obliged to relieve.</li>
		<li>If we do not wish to fight, we can prevent our opponent from engaging us even though we are very underprepared. All we need do is throw something odd and unaccountable in his way.</li>
		
		<p class="comment">Causing your opponent to question his attack can take many forms, a counter-attack, a unit composition he was unprepared for, hallucinations. One can also delay an opponent's forces by harassing the army's supply lines, or holding choke points where numbers mean less.</p>
		
		<li>By discovering our opponent's composition, location and numbers while remaining invisible ourselves, we can keep our forces concentrated, while the enemy's must be divided.</li>
		
		<p class="comment">This is less true then it should be. Though it is worth mentioning because as player's awareness of strategy increases distributed forces will be utilized</p>
	
		<li>We can form a single united body, while the enemy must split up into fractions. Hence there will be a whole pitted against separate parts of a whole, which means that we shall be many to our opponent's few.</li>
		<li>And if we are able thus to attack an inferior force with a superior one, our opponents will be in dire straits.</li>
		<li>The spot where we intend to fight must not be made known; for then the enemy will have to prepare against a possible attack at several different points; and his forces being thus distributed in many directions, the numbers we shall have to face at any given point will be proportionately few.</li>
		<li>For should the enemy strengthen his front, he will weaken his main; should he strengthen his base defense, he will weaken his front; should he strengthen his left, he will weaken his right; should he strengthen his right, he will weaken his left. If he sends reinforcements everywhere, he will everywhere be weak.</li>
		<li>Numerical weakness comes from having to prepare against multiple possible attack angles; numerical strength, from compelling our adversary to make these preparations against us.</li>
		<li>Knowing the place and the time of the coming battle, we may concentrate from the greatest distances in order to fight.</li>
		<li>But if neither time nor place be known, then the left wing will be incapable of re-enforcing the right, the right equally incapable of aiding the left, the front unable to relieve the main, or the main to support the front. How much more so if the furthest portions of the army are 60 seconds apart, and even the nearest are separated by 10 seconds!</li>
		<li>Though our opponent be stronger in numbers, we may prevent him from fighting. Scout so as to discover his plans and the likelihood of their success.</li>
		<li>Push him, and learn the principle of his activity or inactivity. Force him to reveal himself, so as to find out his vulnerable spots.</li>
		<li>Carefully compare the opposing army with your own, so that you may know where strength is superabundant and where it is deficient.</li>
		<li>In making tactical unit compositions, the highest goodness you can attain is to conceal them; conceal your unit compositions, and you will be safe from the calculations of the wisest brains.</li>
		<li>How victory may be produced for them out of the enemy's own unit composition and tactics--that is what the multitude cannot comprehend.</li>
		<li>All men can see the tactics whereby I conquer, but what none can see is the strategy out of which victory is evolved.</li>
		
		<p class="comment">Tactics are formations and positional gambits which one uses in battle to gain advantage over your opponent. Strategy is fundamentally a study and manipulation of that which is human.</p>
	
		<li>Do not repeat the tactics which have gained you one victory, but let your methods be regulated by the infinite variety of circumstances.</li>
		<li>Military tactics are like unto water; for water in its natural course runs away from high places and hastens downwards.</li>
		<li>So in war, the way is to avoid what is strong and to strike at what is weak.</li>
		<li>Water shapes its course according to the nature of the ground over which it flows; the player works out his victory in relation to the foe whom he is facing.</li>
		<li>Therefore, just as water retains no constant shape, so in warfare there are no constant conditions.</li>
		
		<p class="comment">&ldquo;In war we must always leave room for 
strokes of fortune, and accidents that cannot be foreseen&rdquo;- Polybius <br /> &ldquo;It is a bad plan that admits of no modification&rdquo;-Publilius Syrus</p>

		<li>He who can modify his tactics in relation to his opponent and thereby succeed in winning, will be called a Grandmaster.</li>
